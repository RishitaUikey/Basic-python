'''Define a variable num1 with a value of 10 and num2 with a value of 3. 
Calculate and print the result of the following operations:
    Addition of num1 and num2.
    Division of num1 by num2 (consider float division).
    The remainder when num1 is divided by num2.'''

num1=10
num2=3
addition = num1+num2
division=float(num1/num2)
remainder=num1%num2
