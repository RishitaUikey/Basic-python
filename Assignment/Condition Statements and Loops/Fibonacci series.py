'''Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34'''


for i in range(50):
        n=i
        n==n-1+n-2
        print(i==n)
